<!-- Catey's Story -->
<section class="section--padding container">
  <h2 class="heading--h2">Catey’s Story – The Wake-Up Call</h2>
  <p class="text--body">I used to be the woman everyone leaned on. The one who “had it all together.” The one who built the systems, led the teams, scaled the impossible.</p>
  <p class="text--body">On paper, I was crushing it—leading in behavioral health and tech, running complex programs, getting the degrees, ticking all the boxes.</p>
  <p class="text--body">But behind the scenes? I was crashing.</p>
  <p class="text--body">I was sleeping entire weekends away, dragging myself through the week on fumes, telling myself, <em>“I just need to push a little harder.”</em> And when that didn’t work, I tried the bullshit we’re sold—time management hacks, productivity apps, meditation podcasts.</p>
  <p class="text--body">None of it worked.</p>
  <p class="text--body">Because the problem wasn’t me. It wasn’t my mindset. It was the <strong>system</strong>—the one designed to break us while convincing us we’re the problem.</p>
  <p class="text--body">The collapse, when it came, was brutal. Chest pain, racing heart, ER visit—convinced I was dying at 30-something. It wasn’t a heart attack. It was anxiety fueled by burnout.</p>
  <p class="text--body">Burnout didn’t just steal my time. It cost me my health, my joy, and years of my life.</p>
  <p class="text--body">That was my wake-up call. I stopped treating the symptoms—and I started building the system I wish I had when I was drowning.</p>
  <p class="text--body">That system became <strong>The Burnout Codex™</strong>.</p>
  <p class="text--body">And now I teach it to women like you—so you can stop surviving the system and start building your own.</p>

  <h2 class="heading--h2">Why The Burnout Codex Exists</h2>
  <p class="text--body">Let me be clear: This is not wellness fluff. It’s not “10 tips to manage your stress.” It’s not bubble baths and vision boards.</p>
  <p class="text--body">This is a call to stop being the best cog in a broken machine—and become the architect of your own system.</p>
  <p class="text--body">Because here’s the truth no one wants to say out loud: Burnout isn’t a personal failure. It’s a predictable response to unsustainable systems that were never built for us.</p>
  <p class="text--body">You don’t need to hustle harder. You need to <strong>reset, rebuild, and lead differently</strong>.</p>
  <p class="text--body">You don’t need more hacks. You need <strong>boundaries that hold</strong> and <strong>systems that sustain</strong>.</p>
  <p class="text--body">You don’t need to be softer. You need to reclaim your fire.</p>
