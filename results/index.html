      <div class="tier-feedback tier--stable">
        <h2 class="heading--h2">You're Steadyâ€”For Now</h2>
        <p class="text--body">
          You're not in burnoutâ€”and that's a good thing. But let's be honest: you didn't land here by accident.<br><br>
          Maybe you're stressed, stretched thin, or starting to wonder if it's all sustainable. Maybe you took this quiz to make sure you're "not that bad."<br><br>
          Whatever brought you here, this is your moment. Your system is still holdingâ€”but pressure has a way of compounding.<br><br>
          Now's the time to build in boundaries, reset patterns, and protect your energy <em>before</em> burnout moves in quietly and stays too long.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Early Signs -->
      <div class="tier-feedback tier--early">
        <h2 class="heading--h2">You're Feeling It. That's a Signalâ€”Not a Failure</h2>
        <p class="text--body">
          You're not imagining it. The fatigue, the low-grade dread, the dip in motivationâ€”they're real.<br><br>
          You're not in full burnout, but you're not coasting either. You're holding it together, but it's taking more out of you than it used to.<br><br>
          This is the in-between place. The pressure is building, and the usual strategiesâ€”pushing through, powering up, pretending it's fineâ€”aren't cutting it anymore.<br><br>
          The good news? You can turn this around. But not by doing more. You need a system that works <em>with</em> youâ€”not one that keeps grinding you down.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Burnout -->
      <div class="tier-feedback tier--burnout">
        <h2 class="heading--h2">You're In It. This Is Burnout.</h2>
        <p class="text--body">
          This isn't "just stress." This is system overload.<br><br>
          You're depleted, running on fumes, and questioning whether you can keep this up. Some days, you still push through. But that doesn't mean you're fineâ€”it means you're operating on survival mode.<br><br>
          This is the threshold. The point where exhaustion turns into something more permanent if it isn't addressed.<br><br>
          You're not broken. But you are being broken down by systems, expectations, and patterns that were never built to sustain you.<br><br>
          It's time for a reset. One that actually works in your real lifeâ€”your brain, your bandwidth, your reality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Critical -->
      <div class="tier-feedback tier--critical">
        <h2 class="heading--h2">This Isn't Workingâ€”And It's Not Your Fault</h2>
        <p class="text--body">
          You're not making this up. You're not too sensitive. You're not failing.<br><br>
          You are in burnoutâ€”and your system is in full collapse.<br><br>
          The exhaustion, the guilt, the brain fog, the short fuse, the emptinessâ€”it's all real. These aren't personal weaknesses. They're the downstream effects of running beyond your limits for too long in a system that never gave you room to breathe.<br><br>
          You don't need hacks. You don't need to push through.<br><br>
          You need structured recovery. You need a reset that respects what you've been throughâ€”and helps you rebuild without starting from zero.<br><br>
          This is not where your story ends. But it <em>is</em> where the old story has to.
