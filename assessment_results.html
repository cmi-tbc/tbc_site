<!-- 2️⃣ Score Ranges Block -->
<section class="section--padding container">
  <h2 class="heading--h2">What does your score mean?</h2>

  <div class="card--score-range">
    <h3>0–14: Under Pressure, Not Burned Out</h3>
    <p>You’re likely dealing with stress, not burnout. This is a great time to build in habits that protect your energy and resilience before deeper patterns take hold.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card--score-range">
    <h3>15–29: Approaching Burnout</h3>
    <p>Burnout is creeping in. The exhaustion, disconnection, and self-doubt are showing up more often. You can turn this around—but not by doing more!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card--score-range">
    <h3>30–44: Active Burnout</h3>
    <p>The symptoms are taking root. You’re running low on capacity and self-trust. It’s time to reset—intentionally and strategically—before it spirals further.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card--score-range">
    <h3>45–60: Severe Burnout</h3>
    <p>This isn’t just stress! It’s full-system depletion. You’ve been operating beyond your capacity for too long. You need structured recovery, now. This is not a personal failure!! It’s a signal.</p>

  <h2 class="heading--h2">Red Flag Indicators</h2>
  <p>Burnout doesn’t always scream. Sometimes it whispers.</p>
  <p>Even if your score wasn’t high, if you responded affirmatively to a few key questions—something deeper may be happening.</p>
  <p>The question(s):</p>
  <ul class="red-flag-list">
    <li>These can be serious warning signs—indicators of deeper burnout or psychological strain.</li>
    <li>You don’t have to wait for collapse to ask for help.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is decide: Not like this. Not anymore.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- 4️⃣ Focused Action Block -->
<section class="section--padding container text-center">
  <h2 class="heading--h2">You've got insight. Now get a plan.</h2>

  <div class="card--focused-result">
    <p><strong>Protect your energy now – before stress becomes burnout.</strong><br>You’re holding it together, but the pressure is real. This is your window to build habits, boundaries, and clarity—before the system pushes harder and the cost gets higher.</p>

    <p><strong>You can turn this around – but not by doing more.</strong><br>The pressure is building, and burnout symptoms are creeping in. The strategies you’ve relied on aren’t cutting it anymore. The fix isn’t more effort—it’s a system that works with you, not against you.</p>

    <p><strong>This isn’t just stress – it’s burnout’s warning system.</strong><br>You’re running on fumes. You’re not broken—but you’re being broken down by an unsustainable system. It’s time for a reset, with a plan that actually works in your real life.</p>

    <p><strong>You’re fried. Most days are a struggle. This is not your fault – but recovery is your move.</strong><br>Burnout isn’t whispering anymore—it’s screaming. You don’t need hacks. You need clarity, structure, and a system reset—before something breaks that you can’t bounce back from.</p>
