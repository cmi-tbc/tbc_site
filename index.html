      <p class="text--body">
        I’ve built programs, led teams, and trained leaders across industries... until I was fried. Burnout hit me HARD.<br>
        I didn’t just feel tired. I felt used up. Resentful. Angry, even. Like no matter how much I gave, it was never enough.<br>
        Now I help high-achieving women stop the spiral and lead in a way that actually works for their brains, their bodies, and their lives.<br>
        I hold a doctorate in psychology. But more importantly? I’ve lived this. And I built the system I couldn't find—the one that helps you recover without gaslighting yourself along the way.<br>
        Because I wasn’t going to let burnout break me. I still had sh*t to do.
